# HCI584_python_refresher

- This contains a set of follow along .py anf jupyer files for HCI 584
- The refresher is structured to have multiple parts, one for each lecture

May 22, 2020:
- Currently, only part 1 is finished
- HCI584 students: there's no point in cloning of forking this repo yet as it's still being developed
- Instead, I suggest you download(!) this as a zip, open it and copy the relevant part folder into your local HCI 584 folder
- Do this prior to each lecture, open the files in Visual Studio and follow along during the lecture (live or recorded)
- I encourage you to play around with the code!
