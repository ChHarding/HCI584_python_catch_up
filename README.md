# HCI584_python_refresher

May 22, 2020
- Please clone or fork this HCI584_python_refresher repo into your HCI 584 folder so you can work with the .py files. 
- You can fork it but you will still need to pull it into you local HCI584 folder.
- the part 1 folder is the material I intend to cover in lecture 3
- We will go over the 2 .py files, please open those in Visual Studio
- No need to set up debugging, we will just run single lines at a time
- You should experiment with the code snippets, which will of course modify the file and you'll see that in VS and Gitkraken. 
- You could commit these modifications when you're done playing with the code, so they end up in your local repo (.git folder)
- (If you've forked the repo, you could ofc push your modifications ... but I don't see the need for this)


- For the next lectures, I will add more folders (part 2, etc.) to my github repo and you will again have to clone it again to get the updated version.
- This may introduce conflicts with the version you have now. If you want to be sure not to loose any modifications you made you could use git to resolve them. 
- However, it may be easier to just copy your modified part 1 folder into your HCI584 folder directly, delete this HCI584_python_refresher repo from your local drive and re-clone it again.


- you will also have a tmp folder, please ignore it for now. It contains some files I might need later
